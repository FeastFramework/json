# FEAST JSON Marshaller
This JSON marshaller is based on the one built into FEAST framework, however, does not depend on any pieces of FEAST framework.
As such, the needed classes are included standalone, and will not work with FEAST collection classes.

The classes are named slightly different than the ones built into FEAST, so if you decide to use FEAST in the future, you can adapt your classes
using the Marshaller at your convenience.
