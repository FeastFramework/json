# FEAST JSON Marshaller

This JSON marshaller is based on the one built into FEAST framework. However, it is designed for standalone usage in
other projects and does not depend on any pieces of FEAST framework.

The classes are named slightly different than the ones built into FEAST, so if you decide to use FEAST in the future,
you can adapt your classes using the Marshaller at your convenience.
